# si507_final_project

The project is about creating a book recommendation application. I used flask to build an interface where the user can search for Reddit posts about book recommendations. After they decide on which book to read about, they can also find book information such as book availability, rating, and price on Google Books.
 
This project requested data from the Reddit API and Google Books API. The API Keys and Secret are saved in separate files and secured in the .gitignore file.
 
To run the program, download the whole package and run the .py file on the terminal.
