She moved from New York to San Francisco, where she landed at a big-data startup in the heart of the Silicon Valley bubble: a world of surreal extravagance, dubious success, and fresh-faced entrepreneurs hell-bent on domination, glory, and, of course, progress. Anna arrived amidst a massive cultural shift, as the tech industry rapidly transformed into a locus of wealth and power rivaling Wall Street. But amid the company ski vacations and in-office speakeasies, boyish camaraderie and ride-or-die corporate fealty, a new Silicon Valley began to emerge: one in far over its head, one that enriched itself at the expense of the idyllic future it claimed to be building. Part coming-age-story, part portrait of an already-bygone era, Anna Wiener\u2019s memoir is a rare first-person glimpse into high-flying, reckless startup culture at a time of unchecked ambition, unregulated surveillance, wild fortune, and accelerating political power. With wit, candor, and heart, Anna deftly charts the tech industry\u2019s shift from self-appointed world savior to democracy-endangering liability, alongside a personal narrative of aspiration, ambivalence, and disillusionment. Unsparing and incisive, Uncanny Valley is a cautionary tale, and a revelatory interrogation of a world reckoning with consequences its unwitting designers are only beginning to understand.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780374719760"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0374719764"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 288, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 6, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5fqTDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5fqTDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=5fqTDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=uncannyvalley&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5fqTDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5fqTDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 13.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 13.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5fqTDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-5fqTDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13990000.0, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13990000.0, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "giftable": true}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/Uncanny_Valley-sample-epub.acsm?id=5fqTDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=5fqTDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Unsparing and incisive, Uncanny Valley is a cautionary tale, and a revelatory interrogation of a world reckoning with consequences its unwitting designers are only beginning to understand."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ZmFzPrfKBckC", "etag": "esHBS9zyRjA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ZmFzPrfKBckC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Uncanny Valley", "subtitle": "Adventures in the Narrative", "authors": ["Lawrence Weschler"], "publisher": "Catapult", "publishedDate": "2011-10-01", "description": "Shuttling between cultural comedies and political tragedies, Lawrence Weschlers articles have throughout his long career intrigued readers with his unique insight into everything he examines, from the ordinary to the extraordinary.

Although it was intended that this increased realism would allow viewers to appreciate the emotional state of characters, research has shown that audiences often have a negative reaction as the human likeness of a character increases. This phenomenon, known as the Uncanny Valley, has become a benchmark for measuring if a character is believably realistic and authentically human like. This book is an essential guide on how to overcome the Uncanny Valley phenomenon when designing human-like characters in digital applications. In this book, the author provides a synopsis of literature about the Uncanny Valley phenomenon and explains how it was introduced into contemporary thought. She then presents her theories on its possible psychological causes based on a series of empirical studies. The book focuses on how aspects of facial expression and speech can be manipulated to overcome the Uncanny Valley in character design. The Uncanny Valley in Games and Animation presents a novel theory that goes beyond previous research in that the cause of the Uncanny Valley is based on a perceived lack of empathy in a character.

The Uncanny Valley Hypothesis posits that a very humanlike character or object (e.g., robot, prosthetic limb, doll) can evoke a negative affective (i.e., uncanny) state. Recent advances in robotic and computer-graphic technologies in simulating aspects of human appearance, behaviour and interaction have been accompanied, therefore, by theorising and research on the meaning and relevance of the Uncanny Valley Hypothesis for anthropomorphic design. Current understanding of the \"uncanny\" idea is still fragmentary and further original research is needed. However, the emerging picture indicates that the relationship between humanlike realism and subjective experience and behaviour may not be as straightforward as the Uncanny Valley Hypothesis suggests. This Research Topic brings together researchers from traditionally separate domains (including robotics, computer graphics, cognitive science, psychology and neuroscience) to provide a snapshot of current work in this field.

With unprecedented insight into the royal family, Lady in Waiting is a witty, candid, dramatic, at times heart-breaking personal story capturing life in a golden cage for a woman with no inheritance.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780306846359"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0306846357"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 366, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.5.4.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8H-hDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8H-hDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=8H-hDwAAQBAJ&dq=ladyinwaiting&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=8H-hDwAAQBAJ&dq=ladyinwaiting&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Lady_in_Waiting.html?hl=&id=8H-hDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8H-hDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "**New York Times Bestseller**USA Today Bestseller**The Sunday Times Bestseller**The Globe and Mail Bestseller**ABA Indie Bestseller**The Times (UK) Memoir of the Year**One of Newsweek&#39;s Most Anticipated Books of 2020** An extraordinary ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "5EOUDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "DyRurjDMtDU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/5EOUDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Lady in Waiting", "subtitle": "My Extraordinary Life in the Shadow of the Crown", "authors": ["Anne Glenconner"], "publisher": "Hachette UK", "publishedDate": "2019-10-17", "description": "'I couldn't put it down. Funny and touching - like looking through a keyhole at a lost world.' RUPERT EVERETT 'Lady Glenconner's life story is a combination of royal magic, personal tragedy and resilient survival. With humour, courage and preternatural poise, she at last tells the story of her uniquely fascinating life.' TINA BROWN 'Anne Glenconner has written a remarkable memoir - containing, at last, a genuine portrait of Princess Margaret from one who knew her well. But this book is poignant too, and through the pages shine her courage and good-humoured acceptance of her demons and tragedies.' HUGO VICKERS ~ The remarkable life of Lady in Waiting to Princess Margaret who was also a Maid of Honour at the Queen's Coronation - and is a character in The Crown this autumn. Anne Glenconner reveals the real events behind The Crown as well as her own life of drama, tragedy and courage, with the wonderful wit and extraordinary resilience which define her. Anne Glenconner has been close to the Royal Family since childhood. Eldest child of the 5th Earl of Leicester, she was, as a daughter, described as 'the greatest disappointment' by her family as she was unable to inherit. Her childhood home Holkham Hall is one of the grandest estates in England. Bordering Sandringham the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret were frequent playmates. From Maid of Honour at the Queen's Coronation to Lady in Waiting to Princess Margaret, Lady Glenconner is a unique witness to royal history, as well as an extraordinary survivor of a generation of aristocratic women trapped without inheritance and burdened with social expectations. She married the charismatic but highly volatile Colin Tennant, Lord Glenconner, who became the owner of Mustique. Together they turned the island into a paradise for the rich and famous, including Mick Jagger and David Bowie, and it became a favourite retreat for Princess Margaret. But beneath the glitz and glamour there has also lurked tragedy. On Lord Glenconner's death in 2010 he left his fortune to a former employee. And of their five children, two grown-up sons died, while a third son had to be nursed back from a coma by Anne, after having suffered a near fatal accident. Anne Glenconner writes with extraordinary wit, generosity and courage and she exposes what life was like in her gilded cage, revealing the role of her great friendship with Princess Margaret, and the freedom she can now finally enjoy in later life. She will appear as a character in the new series of The Crown this autumn.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781529359084"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1529359082"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 336, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5EOUDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5EOUDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=5EOUDwAAQBAJ&dq=ladyinwaiting&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=5EOUDwAAQBAJ&dq=ladyinwaiting&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Lady_in_Waiting.html?hl=&id=5EOUDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=5EOUDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "If your jaw doesn&#39;t drop at least three times every chapter, you&#39;ve not been paying proper attention&#39; THE SUNDAY TIMES &#39;Gentle, wise, unpretentious, but above all inspiring&#39; THE TIMES &#39;A candid, witty and stylish memoir&#39; MIRANDA SEYMOUR, ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Hm52NCzNeL0C", "etag": "0SoYBwzMzAw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Hm52NCzNeL0C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Lady in Waiting", "subtitle": "A Novel", "authors": ["Susan Meissner"], "publisher": "WaterBrook", "publishedDate": "2010-09-07", "description": "Love is a choice you make every day.

Over the past few decades, the field has developed and expanded significantly, both in terms of professional practice and in terms of research and reflection. The Routledge Handbook of Public Communication of Science and Technology provides a state-of-the-art review of this fast-growing and increasingly important area, through an examination of the research on the main actors, issues, and arenas involved. In this brand-new revised edition, the book brings the reviews up-to-date and deepens the analysis. As well as substantial reworking of many chapters, it gives more attention to digital media and the global aspects of science communication, with the inclusion of four new chapters. Several new contributors are added to leading mass-communication scholars, sociologists, public-relations practitioners, science writers, and others featured herein. With key questions for further discussion highlighted in each chapter, the handbook is a student-friendly resource and its scope and expert contributors mean it is also ideal for both practitioners and professionals working in the field. Combining the perspectives of different disciplines and of different geographical and cultural contexts, this original text provides an interdisciplinary and global approach to the public communication of science and technology.

Revenge is a dish best served cold. Edie Kramer has a score to settle with the beautiful people at Blackbriar Academy. Their cruelty drove her to the brink of despair, and four months ago, she couldn't imagine being strong enough to face her senior year. But thanks to a Faustian compact with the enigmatic Kian, she has the power to make the bullies pay. She's not supposed to think about Kian once the deal is done, but devastating pain burns behind his unearthly beauty, and he's impossible to forget. In one short summer, her entire life changes and she sweeps through Blackbriar, prepped to take the beautiful people down from the inside. A whisper here, a look there, and suddenly . . . bad things are happening. It's a head rush, seeing her tormentors get what they deserve, but things that seem too good to be true usually are, and soon, the pranks and payback turn from delicious to deadly.

The concurrent study of all four together reveals several tensions and interconnections among them that point the way to a greater unification of faith and science. This book explores four foundations of scientific endeavour and investigates some of the paradoxes each of them raises. Kaiser shows that the resolution of these paradoxes inevitably leads us into theological discourse and raises new challenges for theological endeavour. In order to address these challenges, Kaiser draws on the wider resources of the Judeo-Christian tradition and argues for a refocusing of contemporary theology from the perspective of natural science.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781409477662"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1409477665"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 274, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Religion"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-or1WRBWe5IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-or1WRBWe5IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=-or1WRBWe5IC&pg=PT327&dq=abriefhistoryoftime&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=-or1WRBWe5IC&dq=abriefhistoryoftime&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Toward_a_Theology_of_Scientific_Endeavou.html?hl=&id=-or1WRBWe5IC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/Toward_a_Theology_of_Scientific_Endeavou-sample-epub.acsm?id=-or1WRBWe5IC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/Toward_a_Theology_of_Scientific_Endeavou-sample-pdf.acsm?id=-or1WRBWe5IC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=-or1WRBWe5IC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Hawking, Stephen (1988),<b>ABrief History ofTime</b>: From the Big Bang toBlack <br>\nHoles, Toronto: Bantam Books.

George Orwell's final work is a treasure chest of ideas and memes--Big Brother, the Thought Police, Doublethink, Newspeak, 2+2=5--that gain potency with every year. Particularly in 2016, when the election of Donald Trump made it a bestseller (\"Ministry of Alternative Facts,\" anyone?). Its influence has morphed endlessly into novels (The Handmaid's Tale), films (Brazil), television shows (V for Vendetta), rock albums (Diamond Dogs), commercials (Apple), even reality TV (Big Brother). The Ministry of Truth is the first book that fully examines the epochal and cultural event that is 1984 in all its aspects: its roots in the utopian and dystopian literature that preceded it; the personal experiences in wartime Great Britain that Orwell drew on as he struggled to finish his masterpiece in his dying days; and the political and cultural phenomena that the novel ignited at once upon publication and that far from subsiding, have only grown over the decades.

Frank Herbert's original 1965 novel built a meticulous universe of dark majesty and justice, as wild-eyed freedom fighters and relentless authoritarians all struggled for control of the desert planet Arrakis and its mystical, life-extending \"spice.\" After several attempts to produce a film, Italian movie mogul Dino De Laurentiis and his producer daughter Raffaella would enlist David Lynch, whose Eraserhead (1977) and The Elephant Man (1980) had already marked him out as a visionary director. What emerges out of their strange, long process is a deeply unique vision of the distant future; an eclectic bazaar of wood-turned spaceship interiors, spitting tyrants, and dream montages. Lynch's film was \"steeped in an ancient primordial nastiness that has nothing to do with the sci-fi film as we currently know it,\" as Village Voice critic J. Hoberman put it--only with time becoming a cult classic. This book is the first long-form critical study of the film; it delves into the relationship with the novel, the rapidly changing context of early 1980s science fiction, and takes a close look at Lynch's attempt to breathe sincerity and mysticism into a blockbuster movie format that was shifting radically around him.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1911325825"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781911325826"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 112, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Performing Arts"], "averageRating": 5.0, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VkgntwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VkgntwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=VkgntwEACAAJ&dq=dune&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=VkgntwEACAAJ&dq=dune&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Dune.html?hl=&id=VkgntwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=VkgntwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book is the first long-form critical study of the film; it delves into the relationship with the novel, the rapidly changing context of early 1980s science fiction, and takes a close look at Lynch&#39;s attempt to breathe sincerity and ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "0ZKAkX0W4A4C", "etag": "bz8x4tjWetY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/0ZKAkX0W4A4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Heretics of Dune", "authors": ["Frank Herbert"], "publisher": "Penguin", "publishedDate": "1987", "description": "Thousands of years after the death of God Emperor Leto II, the Bene Gesserit and the Bene Tleilax struggle to direct the future of Dune, now called Rakis", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0441328008"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780441328000"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 471, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0ZKAkX0W4A4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0ZKAkX0W4A4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=0ZKAkX0W4A4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=dune&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=0ZKAkX0W4A4C&dq=dune&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Heretics_of_Dune.html?hl=&id=0ZKAkX0W4A4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0ZKAkX0W4A4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Thousands of years after the death of God Emperor Leto II, the Bene Gesserit and the Bene Tleilax struggle to direct the future of Dune, now called Rakis"}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "1N1rTDJP55UC", "etag": "oqloUYy5v3k", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/1N1rTDJP55UC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Dune: House Harkonnen", "authors": ["Brian Herbert", "Kevin Anderson"], "publisher": "Spectra", "publishedDate": "2003-03-18", "description": "Book Two of the Epic Prequel to the Classic Novel Dune\u2014Soon to Be a Major Motion Picture Step into the universe of Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune, one of the greatest science fiction novels of all time.

Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, Captain America, the Incredible Hulk, the Avengers, Iron Man, Thor, the X-Men, Daredevil\u2014these superheroes quickly won children's hearts and sparked the imaginations of pop artists, public intellectuals, and campus radicals. Over the course of a half century, Marvel's epic universe would become the most elaborate fictional narrative in history and serve as a modern American mythology for millions of readers. Throughout this decades-long journey to becoming a multibillion-dollar enterprise, Marvel's identity has continually shifted, careening between scrappy underdog and corporate behemoth. As the company has weathered Wall Street machinations, Hollywood failures, and the collapse of the comic book market, its characters have been passed along among generations of editors, artists, and writers\u2014also known as the celebrated Marvel \"Bullpen.\" Entrusted to carry on tradition, Marvel's contributors\u2014impoverished child prodigies, hallucinating peaceniks, and mercenary careerists among them\u2014struggled with commercial mandates, a fickle audience, and, over matters of credit and control, one another. For the first time, Marvel Comics reveals the outsized personalities behind the scenes, including Martin Goodman, the self-made publisher who forayed into comics after a get-rich-quick tip in 1939; Stan Lee, the energetic editor who would shepherd the company through thick and thin for decades; and Jack Kirby, the World War II veteran who'd co-created Captain America in 1940 and, twenty years later, developed with Lee the bulk of the company's marquee characters in a three-year frenzy of creativity that would be the grounds for future legal battles and endless debates. Drawing on more than one hundred original interviews with Marvel insiders then and now, Marvel Comics is a story of fertile imaginations, lifelong friendships, action-packed fistfights, reformed criminals, unlikely alliances, and third-act betrayals\u2014 a narrative of one of the most extraordinary, beloved, and beleaguered pop cultural entities in America's history.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780062314697"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0062314696"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 496, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 19, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.3.3.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ESwuwYxQNpYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ESwuwYxQNpYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=ESwuwYxQNpYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=marvel&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ESwuwYxQNpYC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ESwuwYxQNpYC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 11.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 11.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ESwuwYxQNpYC&rdid=book-ESwuwYxQNpYC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11990000.0, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11990000.0, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "giftable": true}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/Marvel_Comics-sample-epub.acsm?id=ESwuwYxQNpYC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ESwuwYxQNpYC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The defining, behind-the-scenes chronicle of one of the most extraordinary, beloved, and dominant pop cultural entities in America\u2019s history -- Marvel Comics \u2013 and the outsized personalities who made Marvel including Martin Goodman, ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "vT4ayAEACAAJ", "etag": "MfX7lY0A2PY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/vT4ayAEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Marvel Comics #1000", "publisher": "Marvel", "publishedDate": "2020-03-17", "description": "Eighty years!

The Pulitzer Prize-winning Maus tells the story of Vladek Spiegelman, a Jewish survivor of Hitler's Europe, and his son, a cartoonist coming to terms with his father's story. Maus approaches the unspeakable through the diminutive. Its form, the cartoon (the Nazis are cats, the Jews mice), shocks us out of any lingering sense of familiarity and succeeds in \"drawing us closer to the bleak heart of the Holocaust\" (The New York Times). Maus is a haunting tale within a tale. Vladek's harrowing story of survival is woven into the author's account of his tortured relationship with his aging father. Against the backdrop of guilt brought by survival, they stage a normal life of small arguments and unhappy visits. This astonishing retelling of our century's grisliest news is a story of survival, not only of Vladek but of the children who survive even the survivors.

Ralph Crawford may be a talented short-story writer -- one of the best in the Bay Area, in America, in the 1970s; hell, in the whole English-speaking, late-middle-twentieth century -- but off the page he's only human. In fact, as his wife, Alice Ann, can attest, he's a mess: a jealous but faithless husband, an inveterate bouncer of checks, a plunderer of private misadventures for the sake of his fiction, and an often hapless drunk. When his (similarly human) buddy, Jim Stark -- a novelist burning with ambition, promise, and humiliation over his own failed marriage -- promises to deliver a cargo of incriminating letters to Ralph's latest paramour, a dark lady in Missoula named Lindsay Wolfe, the lives of all four are changed in ways none of them could predict.Careening across the western states during the twilight of the San Francisco underground, Chuck Kinder's already semi-legary masterpiece, twenty-five years in the making, is a rueful, comi-tragic juggernaut of good and bad intentions gone awry, high seriousness and hard living, and the gradual, painful coming of age of two couples who have spent the best years of their lives raising bad judgment to an art.

With deft comic sense, a complex and winning hero, and a supporting cast of vividly realized characters, Kinder writes about Jimbo Stark with the same mixture of fond memory and relief that it's over that we all have toward that time when we, too, were perfectly seventeen; he makes THE SILVER GHOST one of the very best\u2014and most sensationally written\u2014novels of adolescence.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0692687122"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780692687123"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 298, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Adolescence"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T7kKkAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T7kKkAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=T7kKkAEACAAJ&dq=chuckkinder&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=T7kKkAEACAAJ&dq=chuckkinder&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Silver_Ghost.html?hl=&id=T7kKkAEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=T7kKkAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Fiction.

More than fifteen years after the events of The Handmaid's Tale, the theocratic regime of the Republic of Gilead maintains its grip on power, but there are signs it is beginning to rot from within. At this crucial moment, the lives of three radically different women converge, with potentially explosive results. Two have grown up as part of the first generation to come of age in the new order. The testimonies of these two young women are joined by a third voice: a woman who wields power through the ruthless accumulation and deployment of secrets.

Look for The Testaments, the sequel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, coming September 2019. In Margaret Atwood\u2019s dystopian future, environmental disasters and declining birthrates have led to a Second American Civil War. The result is the rise of the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian regime that enforces rigid social roles and enslaves the few remaining fertile women. Offred is one of these, a Handmaid bound to produce children for one of Gilead\u2019s commanders.

Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber\u2019s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming \u201cunstuck in time.\u201d An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut\u2019s writing\u2014the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit\u2014that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it.

Traumatized by the bombing of Dresden at the time he had been imprisoned, Pilgrim drifts through all events and history, sometimes deeply implicated, sometimes a witness. He is surrounded by Vonnegut\u2019s usual large cast of continuing characters (notably here the hack science fiction writer Kilgore Trout and the alien Tralmafadorians who oversee his life and remind him constantly that there is no causation, no order, no motive to existence). The \u201cunstuck\u201d nature of Pilgrim\u2019s experience may constitute an early novelistic use of what we now call Post Traumatic Stress Disorder; then again, Pilgrim\u2019s aliens may be as \u201creal\u201d as Dresden is real to him. Struggling to find some purpose, order or meaning to his existence and humanity\u2019s, Pilgrim meets the beauteous and mysterious Montana Wildhack (certainly the author\u2019s best character name), has a child with her and drifts on some supernal plane, finally, in which Kilgore Trout, the Tralmafadorians, Montana Wildhack and the ruins of Dresden do not merge but rather disperse through all planes of existence. Slaughterhouse-Fivewas hugely successful, brought Vonnegut an enormous audience, was a finalist for the National Book Award and a bestseller and remains four decades later as timeless and shattering a

Vonnegut"], "publishedDate": "2019-06-20", "description": "Slaughterhouse-Five is part autobiographical, part science-fiction, part sarcastic master work by Kurt Vonnegut. It is often assigned by college and high school reading and writing classes, especially when our President wants us to go out and kill somebody. Slaughterhouse-Five came out in 1969 near the height of the War in Vietnam. At that time, our President told us the Vietnam War was a war we had to fight to protect the freedom loving people of South Vietnam from being overwhelmed by the Communist North. We lost that war. Kurt Vonnegut's long awaited war novel proved to be a miracle of compression. It is a contemporary Pilgram's Progress with a hero named curiously enough Billy Pilgrim. He is the son of an American barber. He serves as a chaplain's assistant in the Second World War, is captured by the Germans, survives the largest massacre in European history, the fire bombing of Dresden. (Vonnegut, too, was a prisoner of war and saw that fire storm.) Billy Pilgrim becomes an optometrist after the war, makes a great deal of money, is kidnapped by a flying saucer from the planet Tralfamadore on his daughter's wedding night. He is mated in a public zoo on that planet - to a star of many Earthling blue movies, the gorgeous Montana Wildhack. And so on. Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. speaks to the younger generation. Once mistakenly typed as a science-fiction writer, he is now recognized as a main-stream story teller often fascinated by the magic and comic possibilities of the magazines. His books are widely used in college courses and the groundswell of his present popularity began on college campuses where he was in great demand as a speaker.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "487187916X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9784871879163"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 198, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 1541, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_qWdxgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_qWdxgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=_qWdxgEACAAJ&dq=Slaughterhouse-Five&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=_qWdxgEACAAJ&dq=Slaughterhouse-Five&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Slaughterhouse_Five_Or_The_Children_s_Cr.html?hl=&id=_qWdxgEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_qWdxgEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Prisoner of war, optometrist, time-traveller - these are the life roles of Billy Pilgrim, hero of this miraculously moving, bitter and funny story of innocence faced with apocalypse."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "U55_CgAAQBAJ", "etag": "TI/043EiTOw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/U55_CgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "A Study Guide for Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five", "authors": ["Gale, Cengage Learning"], "publisher": "Gale, Cengage Learning ", "publishedDate": "2015-09-24", "description": "A Study Guide for Kurt Vonnegut's \"Slaughterhouse Five,\" excerpted from Gale's acclaimed Novels for Students.This concise study guide includes plot summary; character analysis; author biography; study questions; historical context; suggestions for further reading; and much more.

Unruly, unpredictable\u2014love is a maddening deity. In this insightful and eloquent meditation on that many-splendored thing, Lisa Appignanesi draws together psychology, literature, popular culture, and her own experiences in order to tangle with love's paradoxes across the span of our lives. Beginning with the rose-tinted raptures of first love, she proceeds to love in marriage, triangulated love, jealousy and adultery, love in the family, and friendship. By illuminating the expectations, the joys and difficulties, and the cultural undercurrents that accompany each stage, Appignanesi raises provocative questions about love in the twenty-first century: Has the unbinding of obstacles to love emptied it of meaning? Do our desires for variety and experimentation result in increased anxiety? What gains and losses have come from greater openness and equality and the burgeoning sphere of virtual fantasy?

It's an American commons, and it is under assault as never before. Journalist Christopher Ketcham has been documenting the confluence of commercial exploitation and governmental misconduct in this region for over a decade. His revelatory book takes the reader on a journey across these last wild places, to see how capitalism is killing our great commons. Ketcham begins in Utah, revealing the environmental destruction caused by unregulated public lands livestock grazing, and exposing rampant malfeasance in the federal land management agencies, who have been compromised by the profit-driven livestock and energy interests they are supposed to regulate. He then turns to the broad effects of those corrupt politics on wildlife. He tracks the Department of Interior's failure to implement and enforce the Endangered Species Act--including its stark betrayal of protections for the grizzly bear and the sage grouse--and investigates the destructive behavior of U.S. Wildlife Services in their shocking mass slaughter of animals that threaten the livestock industry. Along the way, Ketcham talks with ecologists, biologists, botanists, former government employees, whistleblowers, grassroots environmentalists and other citizens who are fighting to protect the public domain for future generations.

The regime takes the Book of Genesis absolutely at its word, with bizarre consequences for the women and men in its population. The story is told through the eyes of Offred, one of the unfortunate Handmaids under the new social order. In condensed but eloquent prose, by turns cool-eyed, tender, despairing, passionate, and wry, she reveals to us the dark corners behind the establishment\u2019s calm facade, as certain tendencies now in existence are carried to their logical conclusions.

The testimonies of these two young women are joined by a third voice: a woman who wields power through the ruthless accumulation and deployment of secrets.

the Booker Prize. Margaret Atwood\u2019s new novel is so utterly compelling, so prescient, so relevant, so terrifyingly-all-too-likely-to-be-true, that readers may find their view of the world forever changed after reading it. This is Margaret Atwood at the absolute peak of her powers. For readers of Oryx and Crake, nothing will ever look the same again. The narrator of Atwood's riveting novel calls himself Snowman. When the story opens, he is sleeping in a tree, wearing an old bedsheet, mourning the loss of his beloved Oryx and his best friend Crake, and slowly starving to death. He searches for supplies in a wasteland where insects proliferate and pigoons and wolvogs ravage the pleeblands, where ordinary people once lived, and the Compounds that sheltered the extraordinary. As he tries to piece together what has taken place, the narrative shifts to decades earlier. How did everything fall apart so quickly? Why is he left with nothing but his haunting memories? Alone except for the green-eyed Children of Crake, who think of him as a kind of monster, he explores the answers to these questions in the double journey he takes - into his own past, and back to Crake's high-tech bubble-dome, where the Paradice Project unfolded and the world came to grief. With breathtaking command of her shocking material, and with her customary sharp wit and dark humour, Atwood projects us into an outlandish yet wholly believable realm populated by characters who will continue to inhabit our dreams long after the last chapter.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780307400840"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0307400840"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 416, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 279, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.4.3.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1GeHO2uy1XQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1GeHO2uy1XQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=1GeHO2uy1XQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=thehandmaidstale&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=1GeHO2uy1XQC&dq=thehandmaidstale&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Oryx_and_Crake.html?hl=&id=1GeHO2uy1XQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/Oryx_and_Crake-sample-epub.acsm?id=1GeHO2uy1XQC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1GeHO2uy1XQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This is Margaret Atwood at the absolute peak of her powers.

Still acclaimed as one of the most remarkable and important motion pictures ever made, 2001: A Space Odyssey depicted the first contacts between humanity and extraterrestrial intelligence. The movie was the product of a singular collaboration between Stanley Kubrick and science fiction visionary Arthur C. Clarke. Fresh off the success of his cold war satire Dr. Strangelove, Kubrick wanted to make the first truly first-rate science fiction film. Drawing from Clarke\u2019s ideas and with one of the author\u2019s short stories as the initial inspiration, their bold vision benefited from pioneering special effects that still look extraordinary today, even in an age of computer-generated images. In Space Odyssey, author, artist, and award-winning filmmaker Michael Benson \u201cdelivers expert inside stuff\u201d (San Francisco Chronicle) from his extensive research of Kubrick\u2019s and Clarke\u2019s archives. He has had the cooperation of Kubrick\u2019s widow, Christiane, and interviewed most of the key people still alive who worked on the film. Drawing also from other previously unpublished interviews, Space Odyssey provides a 360-degree view of the film from its genesis to its legacy, including many previously untold stories.

The essays in this collection, commissioned from a wide variety of scholars, examine in detail various possible readings of the film and its historical context.
